I bet every PowerAutomate consultant wonders if there is an easy way to replace all SharePoint site URLs or variables names in a flow definition ðŸ¤” I could not find the answer, so I built this small (my firstðŸ˜Š) Chrome/Edge extension allowing editing a flow as JSON in a web version of VS Code. Please, share this with your colleagues and feedback is much appreciated ðŸ˜‰
