## Changelog

After almost two years, I am happy to announce the new version of Power Automate Tools. It introduces important fixes and editing of connection references, which allows easy flow copying.

### v1.2

* Fixed the issue of saving a flow
* Support for launching from the new Power Automate designer
* Improved launching from the Power Apps Portal
* Now the editor allows to edit the flow definition and connection references

You can learn more about the extension on it's [GitHub page](https://github.com/rithala/power-automate-tools), [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/power-automate-tools/jccblbmcghkddifenlocnjfmeemjeacc)
