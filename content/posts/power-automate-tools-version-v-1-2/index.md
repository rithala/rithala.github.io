After almost two years, I am happy to announce the new version of Power Automate Tools. It introduces important fixes and editing of connection references, which allows easy flow copying.

### v1.2

* Fixed the issue of saving a flow
* Support for launching from the new Power Automate designer
* Improved launching from the Power Apps Portal
* Now the editor allows to edit the flow definition and connection references

### Roadmap

I am planning to implement the following features in the upcoming months:

* Open extension from anywhere in the "make Power Apps/Automate" portal without a selected flow
* Open multiple tabs with different flows
* Browse flows from the environment directly in the extension
* Support for flow versioning known from the new designer
* Local flow versioning without saving it to an environment
* Snippets notebook. Save a selection for later use.

You can learn more about the extension on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/rithala/power-automate-tools), [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/power-automate-tools/jccblbmcghkddifenlocnjfmeemjeacc)
