      <description>This is another post about generating an API client. Creating API clients is one of those tasks that should be automated as much as possible. In most cases, you just write the same code over and over by replicating the API schema. Previously, I was talking about generating Power Platform custom connectors based on an Open API definition. This time let&amp;rsquo;s talk about doing it in TypeScript and using it in an SPFx project.</description>

      <description>Today Microsoft released the latest version of SPFx (v1.15). This version comes with the feature that I waited most for (and probably many SharePoint developers). This is a possibility to create a &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; list item custom form.
Until this day, it was a very hacky process of making a custom webpart and redirecting users to it by using custom actions or list view JSON customizers. Now, this development model is fully supported by SPFx.</description>
